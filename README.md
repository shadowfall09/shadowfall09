âš¡ The way was long, and wrapped in gloom did seem, as I urged on to seek my fantastic dream~

ðŸŒ± I'm a junior student studying in UC, Berkeley currently, and looking for summer research on machine learning.

ðŸ”­ Interested in Machine Learning, Deep learning and Reinforce Learning, want to explore more!

ðŸ”­ currently working on updating the resource and code I have learned and implemented in class.

ðŸŒ± currently learning Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Operating System...

âš¡ Always looking forward to new things!

âœ¨ Thristy for new project...
